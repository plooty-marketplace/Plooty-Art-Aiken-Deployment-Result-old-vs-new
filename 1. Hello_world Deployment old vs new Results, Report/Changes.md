### Changes Made:
1. Imports and Types: The Datum and Redeemer types are defined according to Aiken's syntax.

2. Validator Logic: The logic for the validator hello_world checks if the message in the redeemer matches "Hello, World!" and verifies the ownership.
   
3. Test Function: An example test hello_world_example is provided to demonstrate how to invoke the validator with a test datum and redeemer.

Notes:
1. Ensure you replace the placeholder owner key hash and transaction details with actual values relevant to your implementation.

2. This Aiken code is structured to work in a blockchain context, where the actual logic of signing and submitting transactions would typically occur outside of the smart contract itself. The test case is a simulation of how the contract might be invoked.
